### Who am I?
I am currently a computational biology PhD student at Universität Bielefeld working at the intersection of deep learning and genomics. I am funded by a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship as part of the [ALPACA](https://alpaca-itn.eu/) project. I am advised by Prof. Dr. Alexander Schönhuth in the Genome Data Science Group. I have a background in electrical engineering, obtained from VTU, Karnataka, India and a masters degree in biomedical engineering from the [Indian Institute of Technology Madras](https://www.iitm.ac.in). I subsequently worked in the industry for four years on a bunch of stuff, prior to starting my PhD. I also had short stints as grade school maths teacher and as a science writer. I also ran DataKind Bengaluru, the Bengaluru chapter of [DataKind](https://www.datakind.org/) for a couple of years in a volunteer capacity. I hail from  from the charming city of Bengaluru, located in the south of India.

### Research Interests
* Predictive modeling of the link between genotypes and phenotypes 
* Network analysis of metagenomics
* Interpretability and privacy in healthcare
I am also interested in the field of single cell and sptial cell biology, and how its intersection with the computational sciences.
